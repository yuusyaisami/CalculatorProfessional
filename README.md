Multifunctional, easy-to-use calculator application.  
Here, they do the calculations for you.

# About this software
Unlike the calculators that come with Windows or iPhone, this calculator allows you to enter your own formulas in the text box and then perform calculations.  
There are currently five operators that can be used in formulas.  
Here is the list of operators you can use  
"+ - ÷ x ^ sin cos tan √"  
# About the future  
In the future, we are considering whether to update this information.  
Well, look forward to it, and maybe we'll start updating again after our next project is done!  
# How to use
In the application, if you press "info", you will find instructions on how to use it.  
tutorial  How to use sin cos tan √  
Put the number you want to calculate in parentheses after sin cos tan  
Example sin(30) cos(60) tan(90) √(64) 
If you write a number in front of it, it will automatically be multiplied  
Example 2sin(30) = 2 x sin(30)   2√(25) = 2 x √(25) This is no exception. sin(30)2 = sin(30) x 2  
The calculations are done inside the parentheses first, so  
For calculations like this, the answer will look like this  
Example sin(30 + 60) = sin(90)   sin(15 x 2)2 = sin(30) x 2 = 0.5 x 2 = 1
