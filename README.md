Multifunctional, easy-to-use calculator application.  
Here, they do the calculations for you.

# About this software
Unlike the calculators that come with Windows or iPhone, this calculator allows you to enter your own formulas in the text box and then perform calculations.  
There are currently five operators that can be used in formulas.  
Here is the list of operators you can use  
"+ - ÷ x ^."  
That's not very many XD  
# About the future  
There are many things I would like to implement, but I'll divide them into two categories: things I would like to add during the week from the date of posting, and things I would like to add after that time.  
 ・ **for a week**  
Add sin cos tan, calculated root, log In or Napier number.  
UI Improvements  
 ・ **After one week**  
To be able to do this kind of calculation method 3 + x = 4.  
Allow graphs to be displayed.  
More items in settings.  
--Too few now.  
Let's not go any further, you'll be tying yourself up in knots.  
I'm not good at math, and I'm in high school and don't have time (it's a Japanese school!) Are you complaining? I don't want to hear it! Okay, I'll do my best...  
# How to use
In the application, if you press "info", you will find instructions on how to use it.  
If you make an error, please let us know, -- and let us know the formula you wrote at the time!  
# end  
This text is written in deepl.  
I honestly hope you don't see this code... No, look at it! We'd love to hear what you think!
